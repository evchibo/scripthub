</ul>
        
<h3>2. Membership</h3>
<p>You may only become a Member if you are 18 years or over.</p>
<p>You do not have an automatic entitlement to Membership and {$domain}
  may, at its sole discretion, elect to:</p>
<ol class="text-list alpha">
  <li>refuse your request to become a Member; or</li>
  <li>once Membership is granted, suspend, terminate or restrict your
  Membership at any time.</li>
</ol>
<p>{$domain} is not obliged to give reasons for any decision it makes to
suspend, terminate or restrict your Membership or to reject your
request to become a Member.</p>
<p>Your Membership is non-transferable.</p>
<p>Once Membership is granted you will only be able to access all
areas of the Sites with use of the username and password you set up at
the time you become a Member.</p>
<p>You are responsible for each and every access or use of the Sites
that occurs in conjunction with use of your username and password.</p>
<p>Use of your username and password is conclusive evidence that you
have accessed the Membership sections of the Sites.</p>
<p>You must use all reasonable efforts to keep your username and
password confidential.</p>
<p>You must not allow any third party to access the Sites using your
username and password and make use of the Sites on your behalf.</p>
<p>You must notify {$domain} in writing as soon as you become aware of
any unauthorised use of your Member Account, username or password.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that you are liable for, and will
  indemnify {$domain}, its related bodies corporate, affiliates,
  officers, directors, agents and employees against, any and all
  claims made by a third party arising out of your access to, and use
  of, the Sites as a Member.</p>

<h3>3. Benefits conferred by Membership</h3>
<p>By being registered as a Member you are, subject to these
Membership Terms, entitled to:</p>
<ol class="text-list alpha">
  <li>buy Products from other Members;</li>
  <li>sell Products to other Members (subject to <strong>clause
  15</strong>);</li>
  <li>participate in online forums;</li>
  <li>generally make use of the Membership section of the Sites;
  and</li>
  <li>participate in the referral program as described
  in <strong>clause 18</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>A reference in these Membership Terms to ‘buying’ or ‘sale’ of a
Product means the acquisition or grant of a license or other right to
use a Product. Members who buy Products acquire a license to use that
Product. This is dealt with in more detail in <strong>clause
14</strong>.</p>

<h3>4. {$domain}’s Role</h3>
<p>The Sites are online facilities that allow you to sell, and buy,
Products.</p>
<p>Ownership of Products remains with the Seller. {$domain} does not
obtain any right of ownership or use (including any intellectual
property rights) in respect of the Products.</p>
<p>{$domain} does not have any control over, and does not take any
responsibility for, the quality, safety or legality of any Products
downloaded by you from the Sites.</p>
<p>{$domain} does not warrant that the Products or any content, code,
data or materials downloaded from the Sites does not infringe the
intellectual property rights of a third party. Each Seller is required
to warrant that its Product does not infringe the intellectual
property rights of any third party.</p>

<h3>5. Availability and Use of the Sites</h3>
<p>The Sites will usually be available 24 hours a day, seven days a
week or as otherwise stated on the Sites.</p>
<p>{$domain} may, in its absolute discretion, and for any reason, and at
any time, with or without notice:</p>
<ol class="text-list alpha">
  <li>interrupt or suspend your right to access the whole or any part of
    the Sites; and/or</li>
  <li>alter, interrupt or suspend the provision of the whole or any part
    of the content and/or the services available on the Sites.</li>
</ol>

<p>You agree that {$domain} will not be liable to you for any loss that
you may suffer as a result of any such interruption, suspension or
alteration.</p>
<p>When accessing the Sites (as a Member) and using the content and/or
the services available on the Sites, you must also comply with any
directions, instructions or protocols posted on the Sites from time to
time.</p>

<h3>6. Fees and Services</h3>
<p>Membership is free.</p>
<p>You do not have to pay a fee to offer Products for sale on the
Sites.</p>
<p>If you are a Buyer of a Product, you will pay a fee to buy the
right to use that Product in accordance with <strong>clause
14</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are a Seller, you will receive the fee paid by the Buyer
(less the commission to which {$domain} is entitled in accordance
with <strong>clause 17</strong>). The fee is collected by {$domain} for
each sale of your Products to a Buyer.</p>
<p>All payments by Buyers on the Sites must be paid using a Payment
Agent.</p>
<p>You are responsible for paying all fees and taxes (including
withholding tax), associated with your use of the Sites wherever
levied (including any goods and services or value added taxes, which
will be added to amounts billed to you, if applicable).</p>
<p>All references on the Sites or in this Membership Terms to “$” and
“dollars” are to the virtual currency of {$domain}, known as the {$domain}
Credit.</p>
<p>All prices on the Sites are expressed in {$domain} Credit where 1
{$domain} Credit is equal to 1 US Dollar which is the currency of the
United States of America. Payment will be made in US currency and
accordance with the rules of the applicable Payment Agent.</p>
<p>The Buyer is responsible for all costs of currency conversion from
his or her preferred currency to the US Dollar, which in turn will be
converted to the {$domain} Credit at time of purchase at no cost to the
Buyer.</p>
<p>Where a payment is made by {$domain} to a Seller, the Seller is
responsible for all costs of converting the amount of the payment from
US currency into his or her preferred currency.</p>

<h3>7. Member Information</h3>
<p>When you want to become a Member and use the Sites, you may be
asked to provide certain personal information to us (<strong>Member
Information</strong>). You promise that the Member Information you
provide is true, accurate and complete.</p>
<p>{$domain}’s information collection and use policies with respect to
the privacy of such Member Information are set out in the
Site’s <a href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Any Member Information that you disclose may be used by {$domain}, its
agents and contractors in relation to the provision of services
accessible on the Sites, including marketing activities in relation to
the Sites.</p>

<h3>8. Proprietary Rights</h3>
<p>{$domain}, its licensors, advertisers or affiliates own all:</p>
<ol class="text-list alpha">
  <li>the content of the Sites (<strong>other than Products which are
  owned by Members who offer them for sale on the
  Sites</strong>);</li>
  <li>the look and feel, design and the organisation of the
  Sites;</li>
  <li>the compilation of the materials on the Sites; and</li>
  <li>the intellectual property rights (if any) subsisting in the
  works described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your use of the Sites does not grant to you any ownership or like
interest in any content, code, data or materials you may access on or
through the Sites or any intellectual property rights subsisting in
any of those things.</p>

<h3>9. Copyright &amp; Trademark Claims</h3>
<p>{$domain} respects the intellectual property rights of others. {$domain}
requires that you do the same. </p>
<p>If you believe that a work of which you are the owner is infringed
by a Product being offered for sale on a Site has been copied in a way
that constitutes copyright infringement, please forward all the
following information in one document (<strong>Copyright
Claim</strong>) to {$domain}:</p>
<ol class="text-list alpha">
  <li>your address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
  <li>a description of the location of the alleged infringing
    material;</li>
  <li>a description of the copyright work that has been allegedly
  infringed;</li>
  <li>a statement by you, that you warrant that the information given
  in the Copyright Claim is accurate and that you are either the
  copyright owner or are authorised to act on the copyright owner’s
  behalf;</li>
  <li>your physical or valid electronic signature.</li>
</ol>
<p>On receipt of a Copyright Claim {$domain} will take the actions we
consider necessary to manage the administration of the Copyright
Claim. </p>
<p>If you believe that an item or user content infringes any other
  type of intellectual property right (not copyright) please follow
  the process set out in
  our <a href="http://support.{$domain}.com/index.php?/Knowledgezipmarket/Article/View/284">Content
  Policy</a></p>

<h3>10. Trademarks</h3>

<p>The trademarks, logos, service marks and trade names (collectively
  the <strong>Trademarks</strong>) displayed on the Sites are, unless
  otherwise stated, the registered and unregistered Trademarks of
  {$domain} and others.</p>
<p>A Trademark may not be used by you without the approval of its
owner.</p>
<p>Nothing contained on the Sites should be construed as granting, by
implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use any
Trademark displayed on the Sites without the written permission of its
owner.</p>

<h3>11. Confidential Information and Privacy</h3>
<p>{$domain} does not warrant or represent that your use of the Sites
will be confidential.</p>
<p>{$domain} is not responsible for any harm that you or any person may
suffer as a result of a breach of your confidentiality in respect of
your use of the Sites.</p>
<p>While {$domain} has taken precautions to protect information that you
transmit to the Sites over the internet, {$domain} does not warrant the
security of that information. Once {$domain} receives your transmission,
{$domain} will take reasonable steps to preserve the security of such
information.</p>
<p>You must not disclose any confidential information made available
to you through the Sites.</p>
<p>When using the Sites or dealing with other users of the Sites you
must respect the privacy and legal rights of other Members.</p>
<p>If a Member provides you with (or your Product accesses or uses)
user-names, passwords or other login information or personal
information of the Member (<strong>Personal Information</strong>) you
must:</p>
<ol class="text-list alpha">
  <li>make the Member aware that the Personal Information will be
  available to you; and</li>
  <li>ensure that, by proceeding to transact with you, the Member is
  giving you permission to use the Member’s Personal Information;
  and</li>
  <li>provide a privacy notice to the user, recording the manner in
  which the Personal Information will be handled by you, that is
  legally sufficient; and</li>
  <li>use the Personal Information for the limited purposes for which
  the Member gave permission; and</li>
  <li>handle the information in accordance with the terms of the
  privacy notice.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the Member has entered into a separate agreement with you that
allows you (or your Product) to store or use the Member’s Personal
Information directly related to your Product (not including other
products or applications) then the terms of that separate agreement
will govern your use of such Personal Information.</p>
<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the user
provides you information about the Member’s Member Accounts, you may
only use that information to access the Member’s Member Accounts when,
and for the limited purposes for which, the user gave permission for
you to do so.</p>

<h3>12. Member Accounts</h3>
<p>When you become a Member you will have a single account that is
accessible by you from any of the Sites (<strong>Member
Account</strong>). Among other things, through your Member Account,
you will be able to access a ledger which records payments by you to
{$domain} (as a Buyer) and payments made by {$domain} to you (as a Seller or
in accordance with <strong>clause 18</strong>) (<strong>Member
Ledger</strong>).</p>

<h3>13. Payments into and from Member Ledger</h3>

<p>{$domain} is not a licensed financial service provider, nor does it
conduct the business of banking in Australia and {$domain} provides its
services as a cashier using a payment processing service rather than a
banking service as defined in the <em>Banking Act 1959 (Cth)</em>.</p>
<p>{$domain} is not providing a financial product or service as defined
in the <em>Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)</em> and nor is it acting as a
fiduciary or an escrow with respect to your funds.</p>

<p><strong>Payments that you make into your Member Ledger</strong></p>

<p>You can make a payment into your Member Ledger to buy {$domain}
Credits.</p>
<p>Any monies that you deposit into your Member Ledger must be used to
pay for Products you buy on the Sites.</p>
<p>{$domain} is not obliged to refund any monies that you deposit into
 your Member Ledger to buy {$domain} Credits to use as a Buyer. These
 {$domain} Credits in your Member Ledger, if not used for a period of 12
 months, will be forfeited to {$domain} on the 12 month anniversary of
 that deposit. However, if you buy more {$domain} Credits by making a new
 deposit into your Member Ledger, before forfeiture of any unutilised
 {$domain} Credits, the balance of the payments that you have made into
 your Member Ledger (comprising both the new deposit and the balance
 of the previous {$domain} Credits) will be available for use by you for
 a period of 12 months from the date of the new deposit. To the extent
 that the new deposit is not used after the expiration of 12 months,
 it will be forfeited to {$domain} on the 12 month anniversary of that
 new deposit.</p>
<p>{$domain} may, but is not obliged to, warn you about the forfeiture
before it occurs.</p>

<p><strong>Payments made by {$domain} into your Member Ledger</strong></p>

<p>You direct {$domain} to;</p>
<ol class="text-list alpha">
  <li>credit to your Member Ledger any amounts due to you in respect
  of sales of your Products on a Site; and</li>
  <li>credit to your Member Ledger any Referral Commissions earned
  from referring new Members to the Sites (in accordance
  with <strong>clause 18</strong>).</li>
</ol>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt only credits for sales of Products by
the Member and Referral Commission earned by the Member which appear
on the Member Ledger will be payable to a Member. Any deposits made by
the Member to the Member Ledger as a Buyer remain in the Member’s
Account and are not refundable.</p>

<p><strong>Payments of Earnings out of your Member Ledger</strong></p>

<p>{$domain} will pay to you amounts earned by you as a Seller and
  Referral Commissions earned by you in accordance with <strong>clause
  18 (Earnings)</strong> subject to the following conditions:</p>

<p>You acknowledge that {$domain} reserves the right to pay any Earnings
to you, at any time, at its sole discretion. </p>

<p>You ask {$domain} to hold all sums credited to your Member Ledger
until such time as you request payment. You acknowledge that, unless
{$domain} exercises its discretion to pay Earnings to you, it will
continue to hold any Earnings until it receives your request for
payment. Any activity on your Member Ledger such as purchases and
sales will be taken to be a restatement and confirmation of this
wish.</p>

<p>You must provide {$domain} with the correct account details and
payment method when you want to receive a payout. {$domain} will make
payments in regard to specific classes of sums as follows:</p>

<ol class="text-list roman">
<li>Sums under $50: {$domain} won’t pay you if you have under $50 in your
Member Ledger unless over 12 months have passed from either the date
of your first sale or the date on which {$domain} last paid out Earnings.
If this time frame is met, {$domain} will pay you using a Payment Agent
(or, for sums over $20, Payoneer) on your request;</li>
<li>Sums over $50: If you have over $50 in your Member Ledger {$domain}
will pay you using a Payment Agent or Payoneer on your request;
and</li>
<li>Where you have $500 or more in your Member Ledger: {$domain} will pay
you by Payment Agent, Payoneer or using electronic funds transfer on your
request. </li>
</ol>

<p>If {$domain} is unable to pay Earnings to you because:</p>

<ol class="text-list alpha">
  <li>we do not have the correct account details or EFT details;</li>
  <li>we are unable to contact you using the contact details
  that you have supplied;</li>
  <li>you have not made a request for payment; or</li>
  <li>you are asking for payment to be made to a person, or to an
  institution in a country, that {$domain} is prohibited from making
  payments to at law or where there are limitations in the banking
  systems.</li>
</ol>

<p>All Earnings will continue to be held by {$domain} in accordance with
your instructions to hold all sums credited to your Member Ledger.</p>

<p>Other than as provided for in <strong>clause 13(i)</strong>, {$domain}
will not pay any Earnings standing to your credit in your Member
Ledger which are less than $50.00 in total but you may use these to
buy Products.</p>
<p>You must bear all expenses incurred by {$domain} in paying monies to
you. Payments made via a SWIFT transfer incur a processing fee of $35
for each payment.</p>

<p>SWIFT, Payoneer and Payment Agent standard terms and conditions
regarding refunds, chargeback, fees and unauthorised transactions will
apply and you authorise {$domain} to automatically deduct such refunds,
chargeback, fees and unauthorised transactions from the Member
Ledger. </p>


<h3>14. Buying Products</h3>
<p>When you buy a Product, you acquire a license to use that Product
from the Seller of the Product.</p>
<p>Products are subject to different terms of use – depending on the
type of license that you choose when buying the Product.</p>
<p>The different types of licenses and the conditions of use are set
  out in the <a href="/licenses">licensing page</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on the use you want to make of a Product, you will need
to select the correct license required by you. You are responsible for
choosing, and warrant that you have chosen, the correct license to
meet your requirements. You acknowledge that {$domain} has the right to
enforce against you the terms of any license that you have from a
Seller.</p>
<p>If you buy a Product, you do so on the following terms:</p>
<ol class="text-list alpha">
  <li>you cannot cancel an order for a Product once the order has been
  submitted;</li>
  <li>{$domain} does not give any undertaking as to the continued
  availability of Products offered for sale on the Sites;</li>
  <li>once your order for a Product is accepted, and you pay the fee,
  you acquire a non-exclusive license to use the Product in accordance
  with the conditions of the license that you acquire;</li>
  <li>ownership of the Product remains with the Seller;</li>
  <li>payment of the fee will be made at the time of purchase; and</li>
  <li>Sellers are not permitted to buy any of their own Products.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Refunds</strong></p>

<p>Downloaded digital items will not be refunded except as required
under the Australian Consumer Law or relevant consumer protection
laws.</p>

<p>If you want a refund or credit on a Product you must make a claim
to <a href="http://support.{$domain}.com">Support</a>. We will assess
claims on their merits, with regard to the digital nature of the goods
and any preview or inspection that was available before purchase.</p>
<p>There is no obligation to provide a refund or credit for reasons
including (but not limited to) if you: </p>
<ol class="text-list alpha">
  <li>have changed your mind about a Product; </li>
  <li>bought a Product by mistake; </li>
  <li>do not have sufficient expertise to use the Product; </li>
  <li>ask for goodwill; or </li>
  <li>can no longer access a Product because it has been removed by
  its Seller from the Site <strong>(you are advised to download Products
  immediately upon purchase)</strong>.</li>
</ol>
 
<p>When a refund or credit has been assessed by us as due, this will
be paid using the same manner of purchase (that is, if the Product was
bought using {$domain} Credits, the Buyer will be refunded in {$domain}
credits; if the Product was bought using a credit card via PayPal the
Buyer will be refunded using that mechanism).</p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that despite {$domain}’s reasonable
precautions, Products may be listed at an incorrect price or with
incorrect information due to a typographical error or similar
oversight. In these circumstances, {$domain} reserves the right to cancel
or reverse a transaction, even after your order has been confirmed and
a payment has been processed. If a transaction is cancelled, {$domain}
will promptly arrange for any payment to be credited or refunded.</p>

<p>You agree and acknowledge that if, as a Buyer, you lodge a dispute
with PayPal we are unable to make any payment out of your Member
Account until the PayPal dispute has been closed. </p>

<h3>15. Selling Products</h3>

<p>You warrant to {$domain} and each Buyer that, as a Seller, in relation
  to each Product that you offer for sale on any of the Sites:</p>
<ol class="text-list alpha">
  <li>you own the intellectual property rights in that Product;</li>
  <li>that Product does not infringe the intellectual property rights
  of a third party;</li>
  <li>that Product is not false, inaccurate or misleading;</li>
  <li>that Product is not fraudulent, stolen or an unlawful item;</li>
  <li>that Product does not violate any applicable law, statute,
  ordinance or regulation (including but not limited to, those
  governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition,
  criminal law, antidiscrimination or trade practices or fair trading
  laws);</li>
  <li>that Product is not defamatory, unlawfully threatening or
  unlawfully harassing;</li>
  <li>that Product is not obscene and does not contain child
  pornography and does not constitute or contain material that is
  adult in nature or harmful to person under the age of 18 years;</li>
  <li>that Product does not contain any content that may be considered
  as prohibited or potentially prohibited content for the purposes of
  the <em>Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth)</em>;</li>
  <li>that Product does not contain viruses or other computer codes,
  files or programs which are designed to limit or destroy the
  functionality of other computer software or hardware;</li>
  <li>that Product would not create liability for {$domain} or cause us
  to lose (in whole or in part) the services of its ISP or other
  suppliers; and</li>
  <li>that Product would not cause {$domain} to violate any applicable
  law, statute, ordinance or regulation by making it available on the
  Sites.</li>
  </ol>
<p>As a Seller, you must:</p>
<ol class="text-list alpha">
  <li>ensure all copies of your Products bear a notice of ownership of
  the intellectual property rights in your Products;</li>
  <li>not offer to or sell to Members any of your Products that have
  not been approved by {$domain} in accordance with this <strong>clause
  15</strong>;</li>
  <li>notify us of any information which may affect or assist in sales
  of your Product(s);</li>
  <li>provide us with full and accurate information regarding
  enhancements and new releases of your Products;</li>
  <li>act in good faith at all times and provide such assistance and
  co-operation as we reasonably request; and</li>
  <li>to the extent practicable, maintain registrations of all
  relevant intellectual property rights and of all names relating in
  any way to your Products.</li>
</ol>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that any Product offered for sale by you
on Sites must first be submitted to {$domain} to enable it to check the
quality of the Product and the information provided with the
Product.</p>
<p>{$domain} may refuse, in its sole discretion, to allow you to offer
the Product for sale on a Site. {$domain} is not required to give reasons
for refusing to allow you to offer a Product for sale on a Site.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that if {$domain} determines, in its
  absolute discretion, or is notified by a third party, that a Product
  that you offer for sale on a Site does not comply with any
  applicable laws and/or these Membership Terms, {$domain} may disable
  your Member Account and Member Ledger and withhold all amounts that
  you may have earned from the sale of the relevant Product until the
  earlier of:</p>
<ol class="text-list alpha">
  <li>any dispute in relation to the Product has been resolved to the
  satisfaction of {$domain}; and</li>
  <li>the expiry of two years from the date your Member Account and
  Member Ledger is disabled.</li>
</ol>
<p>If after two years, the dispute has not been resolved, {$domain} will
pay amounts standing to your credit in your Member Ledger to you in
accordance with clause 13.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that {$domain} will, in its sole discretion,
determine the fee payable for each Product on the Sites.</p>
<p>Products on Sites are continuously reviewed to ensure the library
remains consistent with {$domain}’s latest quality and technical
standards, currency of software and market trends.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that {$domain} may, at its sole discretion,
elect at any time and for any reason to remove your Products from a
Site without notice to you. {$domain} is not responsible for any loss
that you may suffer as a result a Product being removed from any of
the Sites by {$domain}.</p>
<p>{$domain} is not liable for any loss suffered by you as a result of a
Buyer making use of a Product that you offer for sale on a Site
contrary to the conditions on which the Product was sold to the
Buyer.</p>
<p>Unless you elect to become an Exclusive Seller in accordance
with <strong>clause 16</strong>, you are free to sell the Product on
other web sites or through other outlets as you see fit.</p>
<p>You agree and acknowledge that {$domain} may use the whole or any part
of a Product which you offer for sale at the {$domain} Marketplace to
promote the Sites. This promotional use may include use on a features
page on a Site itself, or on other sites (eg social networks). No
compensation is due or payable for such uses of your Product.</p>
<p>You agree and acknowledge that an {$domain} affiliate can use your
watermarked previews in their promotion of the Sites. No compensation
is due or payable for such uses of your preview.</p>
<p>You agree that a Seller may use a watermarked preview of your
Product in a preview of another Product without requiring permission
from you, without violating your copyright and without providing
monetary compensation to you. The Seller must credit such usage by
providing a link to your Product.</p>
<p>You authorise {$domain} to submit a DMCA notice to others on your
behalf regarding unauthorised use or copies of your Products made
elsewhere (without obligation and at {$domain}’s sole discretion).</p>

<h3>15A. Special arrangements</h3>

<p><strong>Bundles</strong></p>
<p>{$domain} may include your Products in promotions such as an {$domain}
bundle (<strong>bundle</strong>). If your Product is selected to be
part of a bundle, you’ll be informed about how to calculate the
revenue your Product can earn as a proportion of the total bundle when
included in it, and any change of commission rate applying to your
Product in the bundle. When you are notified of your Product’s
selection to be included as part of a bundle you will be told when the
bundle offer will be run and how much time you have to opt out of the
bundle. If you do not opt out within the time frame specified, you
agree that your Product will be offered for sale as part of the
bundle.</p>

<p>All specifics of bundles are made at our sole discretion
(regardless of current commission rates, your sales or your
exclusivity status). Sales of bundles will not be counted towards your
marketplace sales for the purpose of calculating the marketplace
commission on your non-bundle Products. </p>

<p>You acknowledge that it can take several weeks to process and
apportion bundle payments and that your Member Ledger will not be
credited immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Special Deals</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we might negotiate volume or other arrangements with
Buyers as part of our creation of business development opportunities
for Sellers (<strong>special deals</strong>). You give us permission
to negotiate special deals.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to pricing:</strong> Special deals might involve
Products being sold for prices that are different to the advertised
prices on Sites. This means that the fee payable to you is based on
the revenue generated from the sales of your Products via our Sites,
which may not always be determined by reference to the advertised
price.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to commission:</strong> Special deals might also
involve a change to the commission rate for a Product for a particular
special deal (as well as the price). You will be given the opportunity
to opt out of participating in a special deal that changes the
commission rate for a Product selected for a special deal within the
time frame we set out when we make the offer to you.</p>
 
<p><strong>Additional license terms:</strong> Special deals might also
involve you entering supplementary licensing arrangements to allow the
Buyer to use your Product in particular ways. If these supplementary
licenses are substantially different from the standard marketplace
licenses, you will also be given the opportunity to opt out of
participating in the special deal within the time frame we set out
when we make the offer to you.</p>

<h3>16. Exclusivity</h3>
<p>You may elect to become an Exclusive Seller which means that you
agree only to sell your Products through the Sites and not through
other web sites or other medium (<strong>Exclusive
Seller</strong>).</p>
<p>In order to become an Exclusive Seller, you must elect to opt into
the Exclusive Author Program through your Member Account.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, as an Exclusive Seller, you are still
bound by these Membership Terms including the terms of clauses 15 and
15A which set out the obligations of Sellers generally.</p>

<h3>17. Commissions</h3>
<p>If one or more of your Products is sold over the Sites, {$domain} will
credit your Member Ledger with the balance of the fee received from
the Buyer (that is the gross fee less {$domain}’s commission).</p>
<p>You authorize {$domain} to collect and distribute such fees and
commissions on your behalf.</p>
<p>The commission payable to {$domain} on each sale of a Product will
vary according to whether or not you are a General Seller or an
Exclusive Seller or whether you are participating in a special
deal.</p>
<p>If you are an Exclusive Seller, {$domain}’s commission for each of
your Products that are sold over the Sites will be calculated by
reference to the <a href="/page/rates">Commission Table</a> and by
reference to the accumulated value of gross sales of your Products you
have achieved over the Sites (<strong>Lifetime Sales
Volume</strong>).</p>

<p>Commission rates may be varied by {$domain} at its sole discretion,
from time to time.</p>
<p>Any changes to the commission rates by {$domain} will take effect on
and from the date on which notice of the variation is posted by {$domain}
on the Sites. (For commission rates on special deals, see clauses 15
and 15A.)</p>

<h3>18. Referrals</h3>
<p>If you refer a new Member to any of the Sites you will receive a
commission equal to 30% of that new Member’s first cash deposit
(Referral Commission).</p>
<p>You automatically have a referral code generated using your
username. This code is available on theReferral Page.</p>
<p>New Members referred via your referral link are eligible if
  they:</p>

<li>are not related to you or your business or company;</li>
<li>have been referred via an external site and not through an {$domain}

<p>You may not refer new Members by:</p>
<ol class="text-list alpha">

  constitute spam;</li>
  <li>engaging in any conduct that would amount to a breach of any
  laws including, but not limited to, privacy, intellectual property

  Membership Terms; or</li>
  <li>engaging in any conduct that does not meet {$domain}’s standards of
  ‘fair play’ at {$domain}’s discretion.</li>
</ol>
<p>{$domain} reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine
whether or not your use of the referral program complies with any
applicable laws and/or these Membership Terms.</p>
<p>{$domain}’s determination as to whether or not your use of the
referral program is in breach of any applicable laws and/or these
Membership Terms is final and binding.</p>
<p>If {$domain} determines that you have not complied with any applicable
laws and/or these Membership Terms, {$domain} will disable your Member
Account and withhold all Referral Commissions that may be payable by
{$domain} to you at the time it becomes aware of your failure to
comply.</p>

{$domain} password and user name).</p>
<p>While welcoming the contribution made by these third party
developers {$domain} is not able to, and does not, warrant or endorse
those applications and cannot be responsible for any interaction
between you and a third party developer. {$domain} disclaims any

trustworthiness of the third party developer.</p>

restrict your access to part or all of the forums without notice or
penalty if we believe you are in breach of these Membership Terms or

liability.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that comments submitted to a forum may
be recorded and stored in multiple places, both on our Sites and
elsewhere on the Internet, which are likely to be accessible for a
long time and you have no control over who will read them
eventually.</p>
<p>It is therefore important that you are careful and selective about
the personal information that you disclose about yourself and others,
and in particular, you should not disclose sensitive, embarrassing,
proprietary or confidential information in your comments to our public
forums.</p>
