<h2>Name &amp; Description</h2>
Your item name and description must accurately describe your item and its elements. They should both provide relevant information that makes it easy for buyers to find items meeting their needs.<br><br>
<p>The <strong>name</strong> field should always be relevant, concise, and professional looking. The following are examples of good and bad naming practices:</p>
<div class="notice"><strong>Good:</strong> 
<ul>
<li> “This is the File Name” – Capitalize the first letter in each word. Small words like “of” and “an” may be lowercase.</li>
<li>“Template with CMS” – Capitalize acronyms and abbreviations like XML and PSD.</li>
<li> “WordPress Template” – Do follow the industry standard even if it doesn’t follow the normal capitalization rules. For example, use jQuery and WordPress instead of Jquery and Wordpress. </li>
</ul>
<strong>Bad:</strong> 
<ul>
<li> “THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE” – Do not use all CAPS.</li>
<li> “this is also not acceptable” – Do not use all lowercase.</li>
<li> “Beautiful File” or “The Best Template” – Do not use subjective words like brilliant, amazing, or best. These words describe your opinion rather than what the file actually is.</li>
<li> “User9909 – File Name” – Do not append your username or any other less-relevant information to the file name. </li>
<li>“Apple-like Design” – Do not describe what your item is similar to in its title, describe what it actually is. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p1">Your <strong>description</strong> must accurately describe all elements of your main file—ensure you mention anything shown in the preview not included in the main .zip and note if any main element is rasterized, outlined or otherwise not editable. If you're using non-standard fonts in your item, these must be documented in your description.</p>
<p class="p1">You should not include links to external, competing services including items for sale on your own website. What links can I place in my item description, preview, or the in download itself?</a></p>
<h2>Files</h2>

<h3>Thumbnail</h3>
<p>Create an <strong>80x80 JPG</strong>, <strong>PNG</strong> or <strong>GIF</strong> for your thumbnail. Make sure your thumbnail accurately represents your file.</p>
<h3>Main File</h3>
<p>Save your main files into a .zip folder, including all instructions. Ensure the files are organised in a clear and orderly fashion.</p>
<h3>Preview Image Set </h3>
<p>You can provide additional preview images. They must be&nbsp;<strong>JPGs</strong> no larger than <strong>590x300px</strong>, and named in the order that you want them to appear using the following format: <em>01_preview1.jpg, 02_preview2.jpg, 03_closeup.jpg</em>. Create a <strong>.zip</strong> folder containing your additional preview images.</p>
<h2>Category &amp; Attributes</h2>
<p>Choose a suitable <strong>category</strong> for your file.&nbsp;<br>Select which filetypes are included in your download (you can select multiple items by holding down the <em>CTRL</em> key on Windows or the <em>COMMAND</em> key on OS X).<br>Select which software and versions of software your file can be opened in.<strong><br></strong></p>
Ensure you match any attributes in these forms to the attributes of your file. <br>

<h2>Tags</h2>
<p>Tags should be lower case, separated by commas, spelled correctly (using American Standard English) and should relate to your item, its specifications and its possible uses.&nbsp;<strong>Do not </strong>use the same tags for every item. Each tag must be relevant to the item it is applied to.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Notes to the Reviewer</h2>
<p>Enter any relevant information you wish to send to the reviewer.</p>
<p>When using images containing recognizable human faces or private locations, link to a scanned version of a filled out and signed model or location release. .</p>
