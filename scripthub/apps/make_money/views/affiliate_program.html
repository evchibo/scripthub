  <p><img class="right" src="/static/img/refer.png" alt="">Refer new users to our <a href="#">{$domain} Marketplace</a> and you’ll receive 30% of their first purchase or cash deposit! Every user automatically has a referral code. Simply paste a link or image button on your site using that code. If a new user clicks your referrer link and proceeds to sign up an account and purchase an item or deposit money via any Envato Marketplace, you will receive 30% of that person’s first cash deposit or purchase price. So if they deposit $20 into their account, you get $6; if they deposit $100, you get $30; if they buy a $200 item, you’ll get $60!</p>
  <h2 class="underlined">How it Works</h2>
  <p>Here are a few important points about how it works:</p>
  <ul class="text-list">
    <li>We use cookies to track people who have clicked on your link, so they need to be using cookies for us to track them</li>
    <li>If a person clears their cookies then we can’t track them any more</li>
    <li>If a person clicks on your referral link and then later they click on someone else’s, yours is the one that counts</li>
    <li>If a person clicks a link, they have three months before the cookie expires. If they sign-up and make a purchase, then you earn the commission. There is no time limit on the referral program.</li>
    <li>Commissions appear in your cash account just like item sales </li>
    <li>Linking from an Envato Marketplaces to itself in order to gain referrals is not allowed. This includes bouncing links of other domains in order to add a referral</li>
    <li>If you have visited one of the Envato Marketplaces before and then click a referral link, it doesn’t count</li>
    <li>Above all, use of the referral program is subject to a fair usage policy which gives Envato the right to review each and every referral</li>
  </ul>


  <h2 class="underlined">Your Referral Links</h2>
  <p>
    <strong> To use our program, simply add your username to the referral url. It doesn't get any easier!</strong> 
  </p>
  <p>
    Or, if you know what you're doing, simply add <code>{$domain}/ref=username</code> to the URL's query string, replacing <code>username</code> with your own username.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    Referral codes will <em>not</em> work on links to an item's fullscreen preview if the Marketplace preview bar at the top of the page has been closed.
  </p>

  <h2 class="underlined">Banners and Logos</h2>
  <p>You can find all the <a href="/make_money/banners_and_logos">marketplace logos and plenty of banners on this page</a>.</p>
