  <h2 class="underlined" id="faqs">FAQ’s</h2>
  <p>Q: How do authors get paid?<br>
  A: Here’s the <a href="/help/withdraw">info on when and how you will get paid</a>.</p>
  <p>Q: Do you have a referral program?<br>
  A: Yes, if you refer a new member, you get 30% of their first deposit, whether they buy your file or someone else’s. Here’s more info on our <a href="/make_money/affiliate_program">referral program</a>.</p>
  <p>Q: Do I retain the rights to my own file?<br>
  A: Yes, it’s your file. We just provide a venue to sell it.</p>
  <p>Q: Can my payment rate ever go down?<br>
  A: Nope, unlike some of the other major stock marketplaces your rate will never go down, regardless of sales volume.</p>
  <p>Q: Are files reviewed or will you accept anything?<br>
  A: Each file goes through a rigorous reviewing process to make sure the quality is top notch. That’s why so many buyers choose our marketplaces over those that accept lower quality files.</p>
  <p>Q: Can I make more money by selling exclusively with Envato?<br>
  A: Yes. Here is the full <a href="/make_money/payment_rates">breakdown of rates</a> depending on exclusivity.</p>
  <p>Q: Is exclusivity based on the author or the individual file? Meaning, could I sell one file here and sell a completely different one on my own site?<br>
  A: Exclusivity is on a per file basis so yes, as long as the files are completely different, you could sell one here and one on your site.</p>
  <p>Q: I don’t want to have my files sold with the extended license. Can I opt out?<br>
  A: Yes, but there are definite advantages to opting in.</p>
  <p>Q: Who is responsible for copyright violations in files I’ve submitted?<br>
  A: As the author, it’s your responsibility to make sure you’re not violating anyone’s copyright by uploading your  file. If you’re unsure if you’re allowed to use an asset within your file, ask the asset’s owner or a lawyer.</p>
  <p>Q: Who determines the price of my file?<br>
  A: All files are priced by Envato and its staff, to ensure prices consistently reflect factors such as quality, complexity, potential demand and licence type.</p>
  <p>Q: Am I required to support the files I upload?<br>
  A: Providing support is a great way to ensure repeat business from buyers, but no, it’s not required unless the file is actually broken.</p>
  <p>Q: Are there file types that you already have plenty of that you no longer accept?<br>
  A: If a category is oversaturated, that just means the quality standards go up. You’ll have to give it a unique spin or make it much nicer looking for it to be approved.</p>
