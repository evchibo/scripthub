<p>Unfortunately Support cannot assist you if you are experiencing general technical difficulties with an item that you have purchased on the Marketplace. If you are having difficulty getting an item you have purchased to work properly, please follow these simple steps.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Read the documentation that was provided with the file, even if you are an experienced user. There are often essential instructions contained in these documents.</li>
	<li>Read the comments and FAQ tab on the item page. If you\'re having a problem, chances are another buyer has been in the same position. There may already be an answer to your question there. If your problem hasn\'t yet been addressed, you can post a new question on the item page.</li>
	<li>Ensure you have the technical skills required to utilize the file effectively. Generally all files purchased on the Marketplace will require at least some prior knowledge to use correctly. If you\'re not sure, try searching Google for a how-to.</li>
	<li>If you still cannot get the file to work as desired, you can contact the author of the file via their profile page on the Marketplace. It is important to note that, although encouraged to do so <strong>authors ARE NOT required to provide Support and you are not guaranteed a response.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have completed these steps and still believe the file is not as described or malfunctioning, you may request a refund in the form of a site credit.</p>
<h3>Our refund policy</h3>
<p>We will happily issue a refund as a site credit for any file which is not as described, or if it is malfunctioning. In instances where a file has been purchased incorrectly, we will only refund if you have not already downloaded the file.</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong> - initiating an unauthorized chargeback with your financial institution or illegitimately disputing a transaction using PayPal or MoneyBookers is considered fraud and will result in the disablement of your account until the issue has been resolved. Please note that deposits are non-refundable as laid out in our Membership Terms and Conditions (Clause 13. Payments from Member Ledger).</p>',
